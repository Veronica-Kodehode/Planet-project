          Jupiter is believed to be the oldest planet in the Solar System ,
          having formed just one million years after the Sun and roughly 50
          million years before Earth.

          During its formation, Jupiter's mass gradually increased until it had
          20 times the mass of the Earth, approximately half of which was made
          up of silicates, ices and other heavy-element constituents.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraphs">
        <p>
          When the proto-Jupiter grew larger than 50 Earth masses it created a
          gap in the solar nebula. Thereafter, the growing planet reached its
          final mass in 3â€“4 million years.

      <div class="paragraphs">
        <p>
          Since Jupiter is made of the same elements as the Sun (hydrogen and
          helium) it has been suggested that the Solar System might have been
          early in its formation a system of multiple protostars, which are
          quite common, with Jupiter being the second but failed protostar. But
          the Solar System never developed into a system of multiple stars and
          Jupiter today does not qualitfy as a protostar or brown dwarf since it
          has not enough mass to fuse hydrogen.
