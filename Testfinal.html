              Jupiter is believed to be the oldest planet in the Solar System ,
              having formed just one million years after the Sun and roughly 50
              million years before Earth.

            <p class="text">
              During its formation, Jupiter's mass gradually increased until it
              had 20 times the mass of the Earth, approximately half of which
              was made up of silicates, ices and other heavy-element
              constituents.

            </p>
            <p class="text">
              Since Jupiter is made of the same elements as the Sun (hydrogen
              and helium) it has been suggested that the Solar System might have
              been early in its formation a system of multiple protostars, which
              are quite common, with Jupiter being the second but failed
              protostar.

              Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system. It is
              a gass giant and is more than twice as massive as all the other
              planets combined.

            <p class="text">
              Jupiter's stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of

              Jupiter has the shortest day in the solar system. One day on
              Jupiter takes only about 10 hours (the time it takes for Jupiter
              to rotate or spin around once), and Jupiter makes a complete orbit
              around the Sun (a year in Jovian time) in about 12 Earth years
              (4,333 Earth days).

              Jupiter is the 5th planet from the sun. Jupiter was the first

              At its closest, Jupiter lies 741 million km from the sun, at its
              farthest, it is 817 million km away. From this distance, it takes
              Sunlight 43 minutes to travel from the Sun to Jupiter.

              Because both planets travel in an elliptical path around the sun,
              Jupiter's distance from Earth is constantly changing. When the two
              planets are at their closest point, the distance to Jupiter is
              only 588 million kilometers. From its closest point, Jupiter
              shines so brightly that even Venus dims in comparison.

              The Great Red Spot is a persistent high-pressure region in the
              atmosphere of Jupiter, producing an anticyclonic storm that is the
              largest in the Solar System. It produces wind-speeds up to 432
              km/h.
            </p>

            <p class="text">
              The spot is the most recognizable feature on Jupiter, owing to its
              red-orange color whose origin is still unknown.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              Observations from 1665 to 1713 are believed to be of the same
              storm; if this is correct, it has existed for at least 358 years.

            <p class="text">
              The major diameter of the Great Red Spot has been observed to be
              shrinking in size. At the start of 2004, its length was about half
              that of a century earlier, when it reached a size of 40,000 km,
              about three times the diameter of Earth.

              Observation of Jupiter dates back to at least the Babylonian
              astronomers of the 7th or 8th century BC. The ancient Chinese knew
              Jupiter as the "Suì Star" and established their cycle of 12
              earthly branches based on the approximate number of years it takes
              Jupiter to rotate around the Sun.

            <p class="text">
              Because the orbit of Jupiter is outside that of Earth, the phase
              angle of Jupiter as viewed from Earth is always less than 11.5°;
              thus, Jupiter always appears nearly fully illuminated when viewed
              through Earth-based telescopes.

              A small telescope will usually show Jupiter's four Galilean moons

              larger telescope with an aperture of 10-15 cm will show Jupiter's

              The Galileo spacecraft was the first to have entered orbit around
              Jupiter, arriving in 1995 and studying the planet until 2003.
              During this period Galileo gathered a large amount of information
              about the Jovian system, making close approaches to all of the
              four large Galilean moons and finding evidence for thin
              atmospheres on three of them, as well as the possibility of liquid
              water beneath their surfaces.

              The Voyager missions in 1979 vastly improved the understanding of

              Europa's magnetic field and aims to confirm that Europa's ocean
              exists, measure its depth and salinity, and measure the moon's ice

              he existence of the planet Jupiter has been known since ancient

              The god Jupiter is the Roman counterpart of Zeus, and he is the
              principal god of Roman mythology. The Romans originally called
              Jupiter the "star of Jupiter", as they believed it to be sacred to
              its namesake god.

              The mythical Greek name for this planet is Zeus, also referred to
              as Dias, the planetary name of which is retained in modern Greek.
              The ancient Greeks knew the planet as Phaethon, meaning "shining

            <p class="text">
              It has made appearances in fiction since at least the 1752 novel
              Micromégas by Voltaire, wherein an alien from Sirius and another
              from Saturn pass Jupiter's satellites and land on the planet
              itself. In the 1800s, writers typically assumed that Jupiter was
              not only solid but also an Earth-like world and depicted it
              accordingly.

              Europa is one of the largest of Jupiters more than 90 moons. It's
              the sixth-closest moon to the planet. Europa and Jupiters three
              other largest moons - Io, Ganymede, and Callisto - were the first
              moons discovered beyond Earth. They are called the Galilean moons
              after Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, who first observed them
              with a homemade telescope in January 1610.

            <p class="text">
              Europa is primarily made of silicate rock and has a water-ice
              crust and probably an iron-nickel core. It has a very thin
              atmosphere, composed primarily of oxygen. Cracks and streaks
              striate its surface, but craters are relatively few. Scientists
              are almost certain that hidden beneath the icy surface of Europa
              is a saltwater ocean with about twice as much water as Earths
              global ocean.

            <p class="text">
              Europa may be one of the most promising places in our solar system
              to find present-day environments suitable for some form of life
              beyond Earth. Scientists believe a saltwater ocean lies beneath
              its icy shell and possibly the chemical elements that are key
              ingredients to life.

              NASA is sending its Europa Clipper spacecraft in 2024 to
              investigate whether Europa has the capability to support life, and
              is scheduled to enter orbit and begin its search in 2030.

              Ganymede is the only moon known to have its own magnetic field - a
              discovery made by NASA's Galileo spacecraft in 1996. The magnetic
              field causes auroras, which are ribbons of glowing, hot,
              electrified gas, in regions circling the north and south poles of
              the moon
            </p>

            <p class="text">
              Ganymede is the largest moon in our solar system, bigger than the
              planet Mercury and dwarf planet Pluto.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              NASAs Hubble Space Telescope has found the best evidence yet for
              an underground saltwater ocean on Ganymede. The ocean is thought
              to have more water than all the water on Earth's surface.
              Ganymedes ocean is estimated to be 100 kilometers thick - 10 times
              deeper than Earth's ocean - and is thought to be buried under a
              150-kilometer- thick crust of mostly ice.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              When Jupiters magnetic field changes, the auroras on Ganymede also
              change, “rocking” back and forth.
            </p>

            <p class="text">
              Ganymede was discovered by Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei on
              Jan. 7, 1610. The discovery, along with his discovery of three
              other large moons around Jupiter, was the first time a moon was
              discovered orbiting a planet other than Earth. The discovery
              eventually led to the understanding that planets in our solar
              system orbit the Sun, instead of our solar system revolving around
              Earth.

              A bit larger than Earth's Moon, Io is the third largest of
              Jupiter's moons, and the fifth one in distance from the planet.
            </p>

            <p class="text">
              Although Io always points the same side toward Jupiter in its
              orbit around the giant planet, the large moons Europa and Ganymede
              perturb Io's orbit into an irregularly elliptical one. Thus, in
              its widely varying distances from Jupiter, Io is subjected to
              tremendous tidal forces.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              Io's orbit, keeping it at more or less a cozy 422,000 kilometers
              from Jupiter, cuts across the planet's powerful magnetic lines of
              force, thus turning Io into a electric generator. Io can develop
              400,000 volts across itself and create an electric current of 3
              million amperes. This current takes the path of least resistance
              along Jupiter's magnetic field lines to the planet's surface,
              creating lightning in Jupiter's upper atmosphere.

            <p class="text">
              In mythology, Io is a mortal woman transformed into a cow during a
              marital dispute between the Greek god Zeus—Jupiter in Roman
              mythology—and his wife, Juno. NASA’s Juno mission is named in
              honor of Juno who could peer through the clouds and expose her
              husband’s wrongdoings. The spacecraft also peers through clouds to
              reveal Jupiter’s secrets.

              Callisto is Jupiters second largest moon and the third largest
              moon in our solar system. Its surface is the most heavily cratered
              of any object in our solar system.
            </p>

            <p class="text">
              Once thought to be a dead, inactive rocky body, data gathered by
              the Galileo spacecraft in the 1990s indicate Callisto may have a
              salty ocean beneath its icy surface. More recent research reveals
              that this ocean may be located deeper beneath the surface than
              previously thought, or may not exist at all. If an ocean is
              present, it is possible the ocean is interacting with rock on
              Callisto, creating a potential habitat for life.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              Scientists think the bright areas are mostly ice and the darker
              patches are areas where the ice has eroded.

            <p class="text">
              Jupiter and its moons are popular subjects for science fiction
              writers and Callisto is no exception. It appears in several books
              and in the TV show “Cowboy Bebop,” Callisto has been terraformed
              and is home to mostly men.
